In my internship with iNeuron.ai, I worked independently on an end-to-end project i.e. ''Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis''.

In this project, I've to analyze the given health and medical dataset for better future preparation.

For EDA and Prepocessing I have used Python and for the dashboard creation, I've used PowerBI.
